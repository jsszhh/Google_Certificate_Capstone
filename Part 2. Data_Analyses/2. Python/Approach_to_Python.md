# Methodology

Working in SQL and even Excel can be highly insightful for cleaning data and conducting some kinds of exploratory tasks, but if we really want to dive into a dataset and understand the relationships/make predictions about future data, we need to use statistical approaches.

As we have a categorical DV, we need to run a logistic regression. As such, machine learning is the best way into this dataset.

In Python, we can do all of this.

## Machine Learning

First, I will start by conducting machine learning approaches on the dataset.

In machine learning approaches, the goal is to train a model to sort data points (in this case, students) into the correct categories of the DV (in this case, course grade), then test the generated model to determine its accuracy.

This is a good start to diving into the dataset because it can highlight the most important variables (features) from the model(s) that best predict the DV.
