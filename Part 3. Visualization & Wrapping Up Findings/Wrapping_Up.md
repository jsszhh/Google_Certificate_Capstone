# What is this dataset showing?


A lot of different kinds of data was collected from a lot of students, and thus interpreting it all in a single study is difficult. A researcher or analyst might collect and analyze this dataset, collect more, and iteratively explore these variables for trends across time in different populations. Looking for trends in variables like "nationality" and "gender", and even in more interesting variables like "hand raising behavior" or "engagement in class discussions", across populations requires more time and data.

Nevertheless, I think I did a good job of parsing through and understanding some basic interactions in this dataset. The big takeaway is:

**Look for interactions between  
`Hand Raising Behavior Rates`,  
`Course Resource or Material Usage`,  
`Announcement Viewing Rates`,  
and  
`Classroom Discussion Participation Rates`.**

Making claims about definitive interactions between such nuanced variables in such a massive population as students between first grade and twelfth grade requires a lot more data than this.
