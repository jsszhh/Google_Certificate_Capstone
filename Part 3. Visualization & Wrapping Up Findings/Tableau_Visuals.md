Tableau was exceptional at visualizing some less-complex relationships, such as demographics. In other datasets, with different data and/or more data observations, more complex relationships can be modeled in Tableau.

Here are two visualizations I made highlighting some interactions between variables.

This one shows various key demographic information:

Some insights from this dashboard are:

* There appears to be a normal distribution for the overall grade brackets (bottom right corner).
* Classroom A across all grade levels, 1 through 12, had the most students in the High-Range grade bracket (bottom middle).
  * However, this is obviously undermined by the fact that Classroom A appeared to have more students in general than Classrooms B and C.
* There were slightly more females than males in the High-Range grade bracket.
  * Furthermore, very few females were in the Low-range grade bracket.
* The majority of students in the dataset were of Jordanian or Kuwaiti nationality.

I also made a tree map which shows the distribution of students in each grade bracket at each school. It also shows the percentage of students in each grade bracket out of all students at their school.

(_Note._ This chart was mostly just for practice assembling and tweaking the elements of a tree map, like the coloration and percentage formula on the individual tiles.)
