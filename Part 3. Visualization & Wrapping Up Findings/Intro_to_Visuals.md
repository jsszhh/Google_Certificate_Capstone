# Methodology

Visualizations can be done in Tableau and Python. There are many advantages of doing visualizations in Python, but just to name a few:

1. Visualizations can be created actively as the data is being cleaned
2. Workflow is tighter, cleaner, as everything can be done natively in VSCode (Jupyter Notebooks) or whatever other reader
3. Visualizations can be created for analyses (e.g., random forest classifier error chart, confusion matrices)
4. Raises efficiency, as no data needs to be exported out of Python and imported into Tableau
5. Code can be saved for later projects and even replications of the same project, allowing for efficient creation of future visuals

Nevertheless, the key advantage of Tableau is its ease of use. To create charts, one must simply drag and drop elements onto a worksheet and the table is automatically produced.

As such, I will create most of my visuals in Tableau.
