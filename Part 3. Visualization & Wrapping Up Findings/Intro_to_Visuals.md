# Methodology

Visualizations can be done in Tableau and Python. There are many advantages of doing visualizations in Python, but just to name a few:

1. Visualizations can be created actively as the data is being cleaned
2. Workflow is tighter, cleaner, as everything can be done natively in VSCode (Jupyter Notebooks) or whatever other reader
3. Visualizations can be created for analyses (e.g., random forest classifier error chart, confusion matrices)
4. Raises efficiency, as no data needs to be exported out of Python and imported into Tableau
5. Code can be saved for later projects and even replications of the same project, allowing for efficient creation of future visuals


As such, I will create most of my visuals in Python. However, I'll still practice my Tableau skills with some visualizations here.
